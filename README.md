# LunaLib
Repository for the LunaLib mod for Starsector  
LunaLib looks to extend or add some features to the base game, and provide some classes that serve to bring a bit of utility to the modder.

While this is not intended to be a community-contributed lib, if you have something that you do want to contribute, please message me about it at @Lukas04#0856 on Discord.
