# LunaLib

Repository for the LunaLib mod for Starsector.  
The LunaLib library adds new features, useful utility classes, and an in-game settings menu for configuring other mods.

While this is not intended to be a community-contributed lib, if you have something that you do want to contribute please message me at @Lukas04#0856 on Discord.

Fully written in Kotlin.
