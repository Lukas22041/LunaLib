Version 1.5.5
-> The buttons in the version checker menu can now be rightclicked to copy their link to the clipboard.
-> Added Tooltips for some of the version checker buttons.
-> Improved how changelogs are displayed
-> Fixed an issue that caused the main menu buttons to appear when they shouldnt, causing crashes if clicked.



Version 1.5.4
-> Potentially fixed a Version Checker related crash.



Version 1.5.3
-> Improved the look of the Version Checker menu
-> The VC screen now allows for a direct download button that opens the download link in the browser (Mods that have direct downloads for mod managers already support this)
-> The VC screen now allows for a textfile to be displayed as a changelog.



Version 1.5.2

-> Fixed a crash caused by some leftover code



Version 1.5.1 

-> Clicking the "About" button in the mod settings now shows an FaQ screen instead of just being a tooltip.
-> Experimental Additions:
Added buttons that open the Mod Settings and a Version Checker Screen to the main menu, those additions are Windows only and will not work on MacOS or Linux. Other methods of accessing the menu are still available as before. The next Starsector update may make it possible for me to include those buttons on Mac and Linux aswell. The Version Checker included works independent of the one included in Nexelerin & the Standalone version, you can have both active.
-> Added "LunaElement" for the Kotlin Part of the Library, which is an easily extendable UI Component.



Version 1.5.0

-> The Mods list now includes icons for each mod, which modders can customize.
-> The settings menu now remembers which mod was last selected and will automaticly reselect it when the menu is re-opened.
-> The settings menu now automaticly selects the first mod in the list when opened for the first time in a session.
-> Fixed the "Save All" button not being highlighted when changes were made.
-> Moved the mod list scrollbar a little again.
-> Added Radio-Buttons as a Field Type for the Settings menu.
-> New "secondaryValue" column for the LunaSettings.csv, currently only used for Radio Buttons.
-> The Strings for the Settings Menu have been externalised, making translation of the mod a bit easier.



Version 1.4.1

-> Added an "About" section the mod settings menu that can be hovered over to get more details about the menu.
-> The debug menu now displays sprites (Credit to Ruddygreat for the code that renders planets within the menu)
-> Improved some tooltips in the settings menu to make them more clear.
-> Added a new Snippet that displays all active Snippets.
-> Moved the mod lists scroller a bit more to the left, to make it not intersect with other elements.



Version 1.4.0

-> Configs can now be categorized in to different Tabs.
-> Reworked the settings saving system.
-> Switching between mods does not reset any changes made anymore.
-> Pressing the Save button now saves all changes made across all mods.
-> Leaving the Menu without pressing the save button will still erase all changes made.
-> The Debug Screen now Displays Icons in the Cargo tab.
-> Fixed certain UI elements flickering when interacting with other parts of the UI.
-> Fixed the mod search in the settings menu not working if an underscore was used.
-> Fixed some snippet ui elements not being updated for some of the recent UI changes.
