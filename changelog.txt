Version 1.5.2

-> Fixed a crash caused by some leftover code


Version 1.5.1 

-> Clicking the "About" button in the mod settings now shows an FaQ screen instead of just being a tooltip.
-> Experimental Additions:
Added buttons that open the Mod Settings and a Version Checker Screen to the main menu, those additions are Windows only and will not work on MacOS or Linux. Other methods of accessing the menu are still available as before. The next Starsector update may make it possible for me to include those buttons on Mac and Linux aswell. The Version Checker included works independent of the one included in Nexelerin & the Standalone version, you can have both active.

For Devs:
-> Added "LunaElement" for the Kotlin Part of the Library, which is an easily extendable UI Component.


Version 1.5.0

-> The Mods list now includes icons for each mod, which modders can customize.
-> The settings menu now remembers which mod was last selected and will automaticly reselect it when the menu is re-opened.
-> The settings menu now automaticly selects the first mod in the list when opened for the first time in a session.
-> Fixed the "Save All" button not being highlighted when changes were made.
-> Moved the mod list scrollbar a little again.

For Devs:
-> Added Radio-Buttons as a Field Type for the Settings menu.
-> New "secondaryValue" column for the LunaSettings.csv, currently only used for Radio Buttons.
-> The Strings for the Settings Menu have been externalised, making translation of the mod a bit easier.
